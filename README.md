Twee/Harlowe build of Twine assignment used in IMM 271 at TCNJ

## Chris Martens' RPG project tutorial
The tutorial was written across two blog posts as part of a larger discussion about "using Twine as a tool for creating prototypes for games research." The two parts of the tutorial can be found here:  
Part 1: http://lambdamaphone.blogspot.com/2015/02/using-twine-for-games-research-part-ii.html  
Part 2: http://lambdamaphone.blogspot.com/2015/03/using-twine-for-games-research-part-iii.html

## Workflow
This version of the project is being written in Twee code and built with the Tweego compiler, using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages to publish the playable version. (I'm trying out the workflow suggested by Em Lazer-Walker here: https://dev.to/lazerwalker/a-modern-developer-s-workflow-for-twine-4imp.
